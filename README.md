#  Apple (AAPL) Stock Price Forecasting Project

This project uses **LSTM (Deep Learning)** and **XGBoost (Machine Learning)** models to predict the closing prices of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**. Our goal is to forecast future prices based on historical data and compare the performance of both models.

---

## Objective
- Predict the next dayâ€™s closing price using the past 60 days of historical prices.
- Compare the performance of LSTM and XGBoost models.
- Determine the most suitable model for time series forecasting.

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- **Time Period**: January 1, 2019 â€“ January 1, 2024
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Column Used**: `Close` (Closing Price)
- **Total Data Points**: ~1,257 days
- **Normalization**: `MinMaxScaler` (scaled to 0â€“1 range)

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### 1. Historical Price Chart (2019â€“2024)
![Apple Stock Price (2019-2024)](apple_stock_price_2019_2024.png)

> ğŸ“Œ **Description**: Apple stock price started around **$34** in 2019 and rose to **$196** by 2024. Product launches, market growth, and macroeconomic factors significantly influenced the price during this period.

> ğŸ“Œ **Graph Description**:
> - **Black line**: Actual closing price
> - **Red dashed line**: LSTM prediction
> - **Blue dotted line**: XGBoost prediction

## Performance Metrics

| Model      | MAE (Mean Absolute Error) | RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) |
|-----------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **LSTM**  | 4.65 USD                   | 5.56 USD                      |
| **XGBoost** | 9.49 USD                 | 12.69 USD                     |

###  Interpretation:
- **LSTM** outperforms XGBoost by **nearly a factor of two** in both MAE and RMSE.
- LSTM successfully learns **long-term dependencies** (trends, momentum) in time series data.
- XGBoost, trained on raw windowed data, fails to fully capture the sequential nature of the time series.

---

##  Conclusion: Which Model is Better?

 **LSTM** is the **superior model** for this forecasting task.

>  **Why?**
> - Time series forecasting requires understanding of sequential patterns and temporal dependencies.
> - LSTM can model these dependencies through its internal memory cells.
> - XGBoost treats each input window as an independent vector and cannot inherently learn time-based relationships.

##  Training Process (LSTM)
### Loss Over Epochs
Epoch 1/20 - loss: 0.2023 - val_loss: 0.0513
Epoch 20/20 - loss: 0.0008 - val_loss: 0.0012



- Training loss decreases steadily.
- Validation loss drops to 0.0012 â†’ indicates **good generalization** with **no overfitting**.
